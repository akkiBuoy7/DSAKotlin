/*
Best Case Time Complexity: O(n) (with optimized algorithm to detect no swaps)
Average Case Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)
Worst Case Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Thus, Bubble Sort is efficient in the best case (if the array is already sorted)
but inefficient in the average and worst cases due to its O(nÂ²) time complexity.
It is not the best algorithm for large datasets because of this quadratic growth.
